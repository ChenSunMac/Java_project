A coding practice associated with LeetCode
---------------------------------------------
Version 1.00
Author: Chen Sun

I have decided to quit PhD @ UofT in EM division and move on to the area of
interest(have better oppurtunity and better income as well as more productive).
I think a continued practice with LeetCode is essential for my understanding
in Coding and CS languages.

I hope that one day I can finish a folder with all kinds of implementation and
answers for LeetCode questions.

---------------------------------------------
The LeetCode is cool but is a total headache for greenhands like me and other
non-CS major students. I hope my way of categorizing the LeetCode answer will
help me and others to learn.
